# Web-Scraping
Various methods of scraping websites for Data are explored here.

A workflow for scraping tables off a web-page is outlined.

A script is also written for using the `read_html` function from the pandas library to automatically read in a table from a web-page, and to then output the resulting dataframe as a csv file. This Python script can be automated using Windows Task Manager to occur automatically at designated intervals, so if a website is constantly updating its info, you have the most recent dataframe available.
